This is an example to test the ThreadPool.
Instead of using a parsing to a html page to get href
we will work with the following reference structure:
   <filename:testSpace/file02.txt> (which by the way should be parsed now).
The next version will modify the program to parse:
href instead of filename
a domain, instead of testSpace directory, etc

In the meaintime, we will add more test cases:

PENDING
1) Get the same reference to file01.txt. It should not try again
2) Get a reference to a non existing file. It should handle it correctly
3) There is a reference to a file in a diferent directory (it will be the case of external link). It should be ignored.

IMPLEMENTED
4) get a references to a 10 files file100.txt to file1000.txt with 100 other references (filecxx)
<filename:testSpace/file100.txt>
<filename:testSpace/file200.txt>
<filename:testSpace/file300.txt>
<filename:testSpace/file400.txt>
<filename:testSpace/file500.txt>
<filename:testSpace/file600.txt>
<filename:testSpace/file700.txt>
<filename:testSpace/file800.txt>
<filename:testSpace/file900.txt>
<filename:testSpace/file1000.txt>
